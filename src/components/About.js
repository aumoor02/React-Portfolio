                <p>
                    I am a Full-Stack Web Developer out of Nebraska who has
                    experience with the MERN stack. I love to learn new
                    technologies and explore the wonderful industry of Web
                    Development. I am passionate about creating interactive,
                    functional, and beautiful websites. I love working on a team
                    with other passionate individuals, and I can't wait to bring
                    my leadership skills to your organization.
